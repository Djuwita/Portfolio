### Datasets

#### Provided Data

For this project, you'll have two provided datasets:

- [2017 SAT Scores](./data/sat_2017.csv)
- [2017 ACT Scores](./data/act_2017.csv)

These data give average SAT and ACT scores by state, as well as participation rates, for the graduating class of 2017.

The source for the SAT data [here](https://blog.collegevine.com/here-are-the-average-sat-scores-by-state/), and the source for the ACT data [here](https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-scores-by-state-averages-highs-and-lows). **Make sure you cross-reference your data with your data sources to eliminate any data collection or data entry issues.**

#### Additional Data

2018 state-by-state average results and participation for the SAT are available in PDF reports [here](https://reports.collegeboard.org/sat-suite-program-results/state-results). 2018 ACT state-by-state mean composite scores and participation rates are [here](http://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/cccr2018/Average-Scores-by-State.pdf) .

**This data has been compiled into CSV files which are also included in the *data* directory of this repo**
