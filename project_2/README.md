# Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

**Primary Learning Objectives:**
1. Creating and iteratively refining a regression model
2. Using [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) to practice the modeling process
3. Providing business insights through reporting and presentation.

You are tasked with creating a regression model based on the Ames Housing Dataset. This model will predict the price of a house at sale.

The Ames Housing Dataset is an exceptionally detailed and robust dataset with over 70 columns of different features relating to houses.

Secondly, we are hosting a competition on Kaggle to give you the opportunity to practice the following skills:

- Refining models over time
- Use of train-test split, cross-validation, and data with unknown values for the target to simulate the modeling process

## The Modeling Process

1. The train dataset has all of the columns that you will need to generate and refine your models. The test dataset has all of those columns except for the target that you are trying to predict in your Regression model.
2. Generate your regression model using the training data. We expect that within this process, you'll be making use of:
    - train-test split
    - cross-validation / grid searching for hyperparameters
    - strong exploratory data analysis to question correlation and relationship across predictive variables
    - code that reproducibly and consistently applies feature transformation (such as the preprocessing library)
3. Predict the values for your target column in the test dataset and submit your predictions to Kaggle to see how your model does against unknown data.
    - **Note**: Kaggle expects to see your submissions in a specific format. Check the challenge's page to make sure you are formatting your CSVs correctly!
    - **You are limited to models you've learned in class**. In other words, you cannot use XGBoost, Neural Networks or any other advanced model for this project.
4. Evaluate your models!
    - consider evaluation metrics
    - consider baseline score
    - how can the model be used for inference?
    - will the model generalize to new data?
